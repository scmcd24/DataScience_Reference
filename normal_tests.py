#### Remember
 - Categorical data are not even theoretically normal

 - Shapiro-Wilk Test
    - Tests if sample comes from normal distribution
    - H0: the sample is normally distributed
    - Best power for detecting effec
    - Does not work well on large datasets: may detect "deviations" from normality that do not matter: use QQ plot to check

- Quantile-Quantile (QQ) Plot
    - 

 - Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test:
    - Tests if sample comes from a specific population distribution
    - 
    - Less power than Shapiro-Wilk in detecting effect
