    "# Bash Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Bash natively only has 3 data types: string, int, and lists\n",
    "-   String and ints can be assigned as such:\n",
    "    -   `my_name='cardinal'` `my_age=31`\n",
    "    -   Note that spaces around the ‘=’ will error, `my_age = 31`, etc.\n",
    "    -   You can reference your variable with the \\$ sign: `$my_name`\n",
    "-   Parameter expansion:\n",
    "    -   An assigned variable is known as a parameter in bash. Parameters\n",
    "        are indicated with curly brackets: `echo ${my_var}`\n",
    "        -   You don’t always NEED curly brackets, but they help bash\n",
    "            know exactly what your parameter name is. Helpful for\n",
    "            contructing paths, for ex!\n",
    "            `my_path=\"/Users/${my_name}/Downloads\"`\n",
    "    -   When bash reads and prints the value of\n",
    "        $my_var, it is performing\n",
    "        'parameter expansion' (PM). Parameters are expanded by default within the\n",
    "        terminal. You use single vs double quotes to control expansion:\n",
    "          - Single quotes: value is treated as literal, suppress expansion:\n",
    "          ```echo '$my_name’`>>>`\\$ my_name\\`\\`\\`\n",
    "        -   Double quotes: value is expanded `echo \"$my_name\"`,\n",
    "            `echo \"${my_name}\"` \\>\\>\\> `$ cardinal`\n",
    "    -   Best practice: use both double quotes and curly braces!\n",
    "-   Indexing parameters: `echo ${my_name:2:5}` \\>\\>\\> `$ rdina`\n",
    "    -   Remember bash uses 0-based indexing\n",
    "-   String manipulation:\n",
    "    -   To uppercase: `${my_name^^}` Just the first var: `${my_name^}`\n",
    "    -   To lowercase: `${my_name,,}` Just the first var: `${my_name,}`\n",
    "    -   Find and replace: `${my_name//old_string/new_string}`\n",
    "        `echo ${my_name//ca/o}` \\>\\>\\> `$ ordinal`\n",
    "    -   Pattern matching: `if [[ \"$my_name\" == *cardinal ]]; then...`\n",
    "        -   Do NOT quote the wildcard, interprets literally\n",
    "            (’\\*cardinal’)\n",
    "-   Lists (technically ‘arrays’):\n",
    "    -   Define list: `my_list=(\"one\" \"two\" \"three\")`\n",
    "    -   Access first item in list: `echo ${my_list}`\n",
    "    -   Access list item by index: `echo ${my_list[1]}` (0-based\n",
    "        indexing)\n",
    "    -   Expand entire list: `echo ${my_list[@]}`\n",
    "    -   `${@}`: A list of whatever was passed, use like kwargs/args in\n",
    "        python\n",
    "-   Command expansion:\n",
    "    -   Like parameters, commands can be executed and assigned to\n",
    "        variables using parentheses:\n",
    "        `num_name_chars=\"$(echo $my_name | wc -c)\"` \\>\\> `$ 9`\n",
    "        -   Like in parameter expansion, commands need to be surrounded\n",
    "            in double quotes. Because the double quotes also surround\n",
    "            \\$my_name, it is also expanded.\n",
    "    -   Use double quotes to perform math in bash:\n",
    "        \\``echo \"In 1 year, I will be $((my_age+1)) years old\"`\n",
    "    -   or use the bc utility (usually for more advanced math):\n",
    "        `echo \"my_age + 1 | bc -l\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More String Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Heredoc: multi-line string\n",
    "    -   `cat << EOF` `echo \"This is a here doc\"`\n",
    "        `echo \"It will just print to terminal\"` `EOF`\n",
    "    -   EOF is the delimiter; string will be anything between those\n",
    "        words; can be any words as long as they are the same!\n",
    "        -   Unquoted EOF: expansion on by default\n",
    "        -   Quoted EOF (“EOF”, ‘EOF’): expansion does not occur\n",
    "        -   When using unquoted EOFs, may sometimes have to escape\n",
    "            parameters and commands: `echo \"My name is \\${my_name}\"`,\n",
    "            etc.\n",
    "    -   Heredocs are sensitive to whitespace - by default, everything\n",
    "        inside the delimiters should be aligned right. You can use `<<-`\n",
    "        instead of `<<` to ignore leading whitespace. (AKA tab\n",
    "        suppression)\n",
    "    -   Can pass heredoc to any command, but usually uses `cat`.\n",
    "    -   Writing heredoc to file: `cat << EOF > file.txt` or\n",
    "        `cat > file.txt << EOF`\n",
    "-   Here string: direct strings to a command: `cat <<< $my_name`\n",
    "    -   No delimiter (and cannot suppress expansion?)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special commands/characters, base:\n",
