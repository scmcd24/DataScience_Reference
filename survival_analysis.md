# Survival Analysis
 - Questions:
    - Impact of covariates on survival?
    - Proportion of population surviving up to event
    - Rate of survival
- Duration times are always positive (and therefore right skewed)
- Censoring: Dealing with missing values
    Left Censor | Interval Censor | Right Sensor
    ----------------------------------------------
    Least Common  <------------->   Most Common
    ----------------------------------------------
    Event happened sometime before start | event happened between two dates | event not yet happened
    ----------------------------------------------
