#### Markov Chain
- stochastic model
    - a variable whose values depend on the outcomes of random occurrences
- Stochastic matrix: Each row adds up to one
- Finds the probability of a sequence of events occuring based only on the current state and the time elapsed
- Memorylessness: model does not depend on past or future states, just the current one
    - Model doesn't depend on a word from paragraphs ago, but also don't know
      context of of previous states
    - (Does this help in terms of speed or does it add flexibility?)

- Use cases:
    - finance (predicting events)
    - Google PageRank algorithm, predicting next word in a sequence
