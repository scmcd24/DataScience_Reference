    "-   Singular: square matrix that is not invertible\n",
    "    -   must have at least one eigenvalue == 0\n",

    "    -   Matrices that can decomposed will have an eigenvector, which\n",
    "        lies in the same plane as the matrix. Eigenvectors are useful\n",
    "        because they describe the essence of the matrix (they occupy\n",
